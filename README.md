# Movie Trailer Website
This project launches a website that displays movies in a tile format.  Each tile is an image of the movies original poster.  When clicking on one of the movie tiles, a trailer for the chosen movie  will launch and hover over the page to view.  This project was written in Python as an introduction to writing server-side code.
